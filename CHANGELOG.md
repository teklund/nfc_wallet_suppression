# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 1.0.0

Major release with Pigeon migration for type-safe platform channels.

### Added

- ✨ **Pigeon Integration**: Migrated from manual method channels to Pigeon-generated type-safe platform communication
- 🛡️ **Compile-time Safety**: Eliminated string-based error code matching - all status codes are now type-checked enums
- 🌐 **Multi-platform support**: Added stub implementations for web, macOS, Linux, and Windows — `requestSuppression` returns `SuppressionStatus.notSupported`, `releaseSuppression` returns `SuppressionStatus.notSuppressed`
- 📚 **PUBLISHING.md**: Complete publishing checklist and procedures
- 🔒 **SECURITY.md**: Security policy and vulnerability reporting guidelines

### Changed

- **Baseline Bump**: Minimum SDK requirements raised to Flutter 3.35.0+ and Dart 3.9.0+
- **BREAKING (Internal)**: Platform interface now uses `PigeonNfcWalletSuppression` instead of `MethodChannelNfcWalletSuppression`
- **Improved Error Handling**: Platform errors are now returned as structured `SuppressionResult` objects instead of thrown exceptions
- **Enhanced Logging**: Better structured error messages with full context from platform code
- **Code Quality**: Reduced manual string matching and type coercion throughout codebase

### Fixed

- 🐛 **Type Safety**: Eliminated possibility of typos in error code strings between platforms
- 🐛 **Error Context**: Platform errors now include detailed messages in structured format

### Technical Details
